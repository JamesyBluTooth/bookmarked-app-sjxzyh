You want to create a mobile app called \"Bookmarked\" using React Native and Expo 54. It will be a social reading companion with features for tracking progress, setting goals, maintaining streaks, connecting with friends, and joining reading groups. The app should have a clean, modern design with a focus on smooth interactions and dynamic updates.\n\nHere's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Dashboard:** A central hub displaying key information like books read, current streak, active friends, milestones, \"Currently Reading\" section with progress bar, and a \"Daily Challenge\" card.\n*   **Books Tab:** A personal library with filters for All, Currently Reading, To Read, and Completed books. Each book should be displayed as a card with relevant information.\n*   **Bottom Navigation:** A fixed bottom navigation bar with icons for Dashboard, Books, Friends, Groups, and Profile, with an animated indicator for the active tab.\n*   **Top Bar:** A top bar with a theme toggle, notification bell, and user avatar.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F9F9F9` (Light Gray)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#6200EE` (Deep Purple)\n    *   Secondary: `#03DAC5` (Teal)\n    *   Accent: `#BB86FC` (Light Purple)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFD740` (Gold)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Ensure the project is set up with Expo 54 and necessary dependencies like `react-native-gesture-handler`, `expo-router`, `react-native-reanimated`, `expo-symbols`, `expo-blur`, `expo-network`, `expo-font`, `expo-splash-screen`, `react-native-edge-to-edge`, `@react-navigation/native`.\n2.  **Navigation:** Implement the bottom navigation bar using `expo-router` and `FloatingTabBar.tsx`. The tab bar should have icons for Dashboard, Books, Friends, Groups, and Profile.\n3.  **Dashboard Screen:** Create the Dashboard screen (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`) with the following components:\n    *   Top bar with theme toggle, notification bell, and user avatar.\n    *   Cards for books read, current streak, active friends, and milestones.\n    *   \"Currently Reading\" section with title, author, and progress bar.\n    *   \"Daily Challenge\" card.\n4.  **Books Screen:** Create the Books screen (`app/(tabs)/books.tsx`) with filters for All, Currently Reading, To Read, and Completed. Each book should be displayed as a card with title, author, and progress bar (if applicable).\n5.  **Theme Toggle:** Implement the theme toggle functionality in the top bar. Use `useColorScheme` from `react-native` to detect the current theme and update the UI accordingly.\n6.  **Splash Screen:** Implement a short splash screen on launch using `expo-splash-screen`.\n7.  **Greeting:** Implement a greeting that changes with the time of day on the Dashboard screen.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-31T10:35:32.299397"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll create the \"Bookmarked\" social reading companion app for you.
